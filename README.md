NZBHydra is a meta search for NZB indexers. It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. You can search all your indexers from one place and use it as indexer source for tools like Sonarr or CouchPotato.

### Note
* I don't have anything to do with www.nzbhydra.com
* While this version still runs fine I recommend using its successor [NZBHydra2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2) which runs a lot faster and has more features. Therefore I have removed all instructions regarding usage or development.
